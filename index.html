Description:
    </h1> 
        Reservoirs of Venice explores the city as a medium for information processing, using its
        physical systems to model and predict environmental changes. Inspired by the field of physical
        reservoir computing, which leverages dynamic physical processes for self-learning systems, the
        project envisions Venice as a data source and computing agent forecasting its future.
        The work critically engages with urban computing, moving beyond traditional data-centric
        paradigms. Historically, Urban Computing has either focused on digital systems—relying on
        sensors and control networks—or analog models that use physical processes, like slime molds
        or sentinel species, to understand urban dynamics. Reservoirs of Venice proposes a third
        paradigm, where physical processes themselves become the foundation for computation. We
        propose a “water computer” that learns from human activities observed from Venice’s bridges,
        such as vibrations, sounds, and the reflections of passing boats. By designing a reservoir that
 
        predicts the time of day based on activity intensity, the installation demonstrates an alternative
        computational paradigm. Unlike energy-intensive digital AI systems, this “computer” is
        composed of the very elements it computes with, requiring only a fraction of the energy to
        operate.
 
        By integrating dynamic systems like water waves, vibrations, or climate patterns into
        computational models, the project reimagines cities as ecological processors. It highlights how
        urban environments capture and document information through physical traces, emphasizing
        their potential to predict and respond to crises like climate change or pollution. This approach
        fosters a new perspective on cities as intelligent, collective systems capable of issuing signals
        and acting as urban immune systems to mitigate future risks. Reservoirs of Venice ultimately
       challenges how we understand computation, urban intelligence, and environmental resilience.
