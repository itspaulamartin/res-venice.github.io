        <strong>Reservoirs of Venice</strong> explores the city as a medium for information processing, using its
        physical systems to model and predict environmental changes. Inspired by the field of 
        <em>physical reservoir computing</em>, which leverages dynamic physical processes for self-learning systems, 
        the project envisions Venice as a data source and computing agent forecasting its future.
        <br><br>
        The work critically engages with urban computing, moving beyond traditional data-centric paradigms. 
        Historically, Urban Computing has either focused on digital systems—relying on sensors and control networks—or 
        analog models that use physical processes, like slime molds or sentinel species, to understand urban dynamics. 
        <strong>Reservoirs of Venice</strong> proposes a third paradigm, where physical processes themselves become 
        the foundation for computation. 
        <br><br>
        We propose a <strong>“water computer”</strong> that learns from human activities observed from Venice’s bridges, 
        such as vibrations, sounds, and the reflections of passing boats. By designing a reservoir that predicts 
        the time of day based on activity intensity, the installation demonstrates an alternative computational paradigm. 
        Unlike energy-intensive digital AI systems, this “computer” is composed of the very elements it computes with, 
        requiring only a fraction of the energy to operate.
        <br><br>
        By integrating dynamic systems like water waves, vibrations, or climate patterns into computational models, 
        the project reimagines cities as ecological processors. It highlights how urban environments capture and document 
        information through physical traces, emphasizing their potential to predict and respond to crises like climate 
        change or pollution. This approach fosters a new perspective on cities as intelligent, collective systems capable 
        of issuing signals and acting as urban immune systems to mitigate future risks. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Reservoirs of Venice</strong> ultimately challenges how we understand computation, urban intelligence, 
        and environmental resilience.
